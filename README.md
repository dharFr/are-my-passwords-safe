Are My Passwords Safe ?
=======================

## Idea

What about building a simple website dedicated to teaching some basics about password good (and bad) practices.
Most developers already know how to manage theirs passwords, but the great majority of my "non-tech" friends and family don't really know what's secure or not.

I thought it could be useful to build a web-site to present passwords related good and bad practices. To me, it has to be interactive and fun as it present quite a boring topic. The Questions/Answers format seems appropriate as it is quick and easy yo use and allows user to see his progress and compare his score with friends.
